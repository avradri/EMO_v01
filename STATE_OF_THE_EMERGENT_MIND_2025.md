# State of the Emergent Mind 2025  
_EMO v0.1 prototype – open data, open methods_

---

## 1. Context

2024 added another ~2% to global greenhouse gas emissions according to the  
Global Carbon Budget, making it increasingly unlikely that the world will  
stay within a 1.5 °C-consistent carbon pathway without rapid course correction.

Most dashboards answer:  
**“What is the planet doing?”**

**EMO v0.1** asks a different question:  
**“Is our *species-level cognition* working?”**

This note reports the first EMO v0.1 vital signs for humanity as an emergent mind.

## 2. Organismality: are we acting like a coherent organism?

Using global environmental treaty participation and conflict deaths, EMO computes:

- **Latest OI (World):** `{{LATEST_OI}}`  
- **20-year trend:** `{{OI_TREND_DESCRIPTION}}`

**Interpretation:**  
`{{1–2 sentences on whether cooperation is outpacing fragmentation or vice versa.}}`

---

## 3. Integrative information processing and ignition

For the topic **“climate change”**, we combine:

- GDELT news volumes  
- Wikipedia attention  
- OpenAlex climate-related publications  

Key findings:

- **O-information Ω (news + science + conflict):** `{{OMEGA_VALUE}}` (`{{synergy_or_redundancy}}`)  
- **Notable GWI bursts:** `{{DATES_OR_EVENTS}}`

These bursts correspond to moments when attention, curiosity, and memory  
line up — a species-level **global workspace ignition**.

---

## 4. Self-model fidelity: do we walk our own talk?

Comparing a 1.5 °C-consistent mitigation pathway with realised CO₂ emissions:

- **Global SMF score:** `{{SMF_GLOBAL}}`  
- **Correlation between target and actual:** `{{SMF_CORR}}`

**In words:**  
`{{Short narrative on whether the planetary self-model actually influences real-world actuation.}}`

---

## 5. Information-time: how fast is our learning clock?

Using ECMWF / C3S forecast-skill headline scores as a proxy for validated  
predictive capacity, EMO builds an information-time clock τ_I:

- **Calendar span:** `{{YEAR_START}}–{{YEAR_END}}`  
- **Information-time span:** `{{TAU_SPAN}}`  
- **Acceleration factor (τ_I / calendar):** `{{ACCEL_RATIO}}`

A factor > 1 means the species-level “learning clock” is running  
*faster* than calendar time.  
≤ 1 means predictive skill has stalled or slowed.

## 6. Why this matters

Together, these metrics provide a first **species-mind vital sign**:

- **OI** — are we structurally capable of coordinated planetary action?  
- **SΦ & GWI** — do we integrate information or oscillate between shocks?  
- **SMF** — does our self-model (IPCC pathways) steer budgets and behaviour?  
- **τ_I** — are we learning quickly enough to remain within safe-and-just boundaries?

EMO v0.1, built entirely on open data and open APIs, shows that such a dashboard  
is not speculative — it already runs today in prototype form.

What is missing is investment to:

1. Turn this prototype into a continuously updated Observatory.  
2. Extend coverage to digital twins, early-warning systems, health and finance networks.  
3. Define **UIA bands**: healthy vs pathological regimes of Ȧ_UIA for the human–Earth interface.

## 7. Call to action

**Funding this work in 2025 means building the first instrument that measures not  
only what the Earth is doing, but how well humanity’s emergent mind is functioning.**
