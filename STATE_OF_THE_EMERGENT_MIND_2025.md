EMO v0.1 prototype – open data, open methods

1. Context

2024 added another ~2% to global greenhouse gas emissions according to the
Global Carbon Budget, making it increasingly unlikely that the world will
stay within a 1.5 °C-consistent carbon pathway without rapid course correction.

Most dashboards answer:
“What is the planet doing?”

EMO v0.1 asks a different question:
“Is our species-level cognition working?”

This note reports the first EMO v0.1 vital signs for humanity as an emergent mind,
using open data and a minimal open-source implementation.

2. Organismality: are we acting like a coherent organism?

Using global environmental treaty participation and conflict deaths, EMO computes:

Latest OI (World): 0.913

20-year trend: 0.0414 per year

Interpretation:
Cooperation (treaty participation) is structurally outpacing fragmentation (conflict deaths).
Humanity shows a strong, improving organismality signal, consistent with an
increasing ability to coordinate and align around shared planetary constraints.

3. Integrative information processing and ignition

For the topic “climate change”, EMO combines:

GDELT global news volumes

Wikipedia attention

OpenAlex climate-related publications

Key findings:

O-information Ω: −9.4869
→ synergy-dominant regime (strong integrative interactions)

Notable GWI bursts: 1 burst detected

2023-01-10 with ignition 0.967891

These bursts correspond to moments when attention, curiosity, and memory align —
species-level “global workspace ignition.”

4. Self-model fidelity: do we walk our own talk?

Comparing a 1.5 °C-consistent mitigation pathway with realised CO₂ emissions:

Global SMF score: 0.182

Correlation between target and actual trajectories: −0.987

In words:
Humanity’s planetary self-model (IPCC pathways, climate budgets) is almost entirely
decoupled from realized emissions.
The strong negative correlation shows that real-world actuation is diverging sharply
from stated mitigation trajectories. SMF is low: our species-level cognition “knows”
the trajectory but is not following it.

5. Information-time: how fast is our learning clock?

Using ECMWF / C3S forecast-skill headline scores as a proxy for validated predictive capacity:

Calendar span: 2000–2023 (23.0 years)

Information-time span: 0.3500

Acceleration factor (τ_I / calendar): 0.0152

A value ≪ 1 indicates that the species-level “learning clock” is running far slower
than calendar time — predictive capacity (validated skill) is improving,
but marginally, at a pace insufficient for accelerating planetary risk.

6. Why this matters

Together, these five vital signs provide a first species-mind diagnostic:

OI — Humanity is structurally capable of cooperation, with improving long-term trends.

SΦ & GWI — Integrative processing is synergy-dominant, but ignition events are rare.

SMF — Our planetary self-model does not currently steer real-world emissions.

τ_I — Our predictive learning is much too slow compared to the rate of risk escalation.

EMO v0.1, built entirely on open data and open methods, demonstrates that
a planetary cognition dashboard is not speculative — it already works today.

What is missing is sustained investment to:

Turn this prototype into a continuously updated Observatory.

Integrate digital twins, early-warning networks, and global health systems.

Define UIA bands — healthy vs pathological regimes of the human–Earth interface.

Build the governance and infrastructure needed for a true planetary cognitive layer.

7. Call to action

Funding this work in 2025 means building the first instrument that measures not
only what the Earth is doing, but how well humanity’s emergent mind is functioning.

A UIA-aligned planetary cognition observatory — EMO — is now technically feasible.
Its first outputs are shown above.
The next step is scaling this into a live, actionable global infrastructure.
